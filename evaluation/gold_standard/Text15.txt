The aim is to remotely interrupt the supply of electrical energy for an object, as a result of a customer change or due to open collection claims, via the central system.
The shutdown takes place by opening the breaker present in the terminal.
From the central system, a shutdown command is transmitted to the affected terminal.
The terminal executes the received command, i.e., the internal breaker interrupts the power supply of the customer system, returns the status of the shutdown to the central system and creates an entry in the logbook.
This status must be visible on the terminal.
With collection there is no possibility of an immediate on-site reconnection by the customer after the blocking.
Input is either deregistration of current customer, customer moves out without new tenant or customer does not pay after admonition process.
The supply of electrical energy is interrupted, the status "interrupted" is displayed at the terminal and in the central system. An entry in the logbook of the terminal has been created.
