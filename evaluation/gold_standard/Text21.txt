In the course of the so-called opt-out regulation, it must be possible for customers who refuse to install an intelligent electricity meter to deactivate the load profile recording in the meter. Activation / deactivation of load profile recording must be possible remotely (WAN interface). Each of these changes must be logged in the relevant legal logbook of the meter.
If the customer is opt-out, it must be displayed on the meter accordingly (for example, display, LED).

Opt-out request of the customer to implement at the NL.

Load profile recording is activated / deactivated and the information has been transmitted to the central system as ALARM or EVENT. A logbook entry has been made in the meter and the current status OPT-OUT is displayed on the meter.
