When a guest calls room service at The Evanstonian, the room-service manager takes down the order.
 She then submits an order ticket to the kitchen to begin preparing the food.
 She also gives an order to the sommelier to fetch wine from the cellar and to prepare any other alcoholic beverages.
 Eighty percent of room-service orders include wine or some other alcoholic beverage.
 She assigns the order to the waiter.
 The kitchen and the sommelier are doing their tasks. The waiter readies a cart.
 The waiter is also responsible for nonalcoholic drinks.
 Once the food, wine, and cart are ready, the waiter delivers it to the guests room.
 The waiter debits the guests account.
 The waiter may wait to do the billing if he has another order to prepare or deliver.
