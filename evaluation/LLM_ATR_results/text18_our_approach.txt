There is an elimination of the terminal on-site by means of a mobile device via the service interface (WZ).
 In order to meet the strict data protection regulations, the cryptographic parameters that authorize the device to be switched off must be stored on the mobile device.
 It must therefore not be possible with these cryptographic parameters to turn off several or all terminals of the terminal equipment.
 The breaker of the terminal has switched off the system, indicating this on the device.
 An entry in the logbook of the terminal has been created.
