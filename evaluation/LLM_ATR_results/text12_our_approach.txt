The controller shall be able to demonstrate that the data subject has consented to processing of his or her personal data.
 The request for consent shall be presented in a manner which is clearly distinguishable from other matters, in an intelligible and easily accessible form, using clear and plain language.
 The data subject shall have the right to withdraw his or her consent at any time, without affecting the lawfulness of processing based on consent before its withdrawal.
 Prior to giving consent, the data subject shall be informed thereof and it shall be as easy to withdraw as to give consent.
 When assessing whether consent is freely given, utmost account shall be taken of whether the performance of a contract, including the provision of a service, is conditional on consent to the processing of personal data.
