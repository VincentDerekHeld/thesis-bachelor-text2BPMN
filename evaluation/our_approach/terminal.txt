    ### Full Process Description: ###
    The sales department receives an order. A member of the sales department can then reject or accept the order for a customized bike. In the former case, the process instance is finished. The storehouse and the engineering department are informed. The storehouse immediately processes the part list of the order and checks the required quantity of each part. If the part is available in-house, it is reserved. If it is not available, it is back-ordered. This procedure is repeated for each item on the part list. In the meantime, the engineering department prepares everything for the assembling of the ordered bicycle. If the storehouse has successfully reserved or back-ordered every item of the part list and the preparation activity has finished, the engineering department assembles the bicycle. The sales department ships the bicycle to the customer and finishes the process instance.

    Note: Return only the improved process diagram syntax as a simple string. No additional text is needed.

    ### Full Process Description: ###
    The CRS checks the defect and hands out a repair cost calculation back. If the customer decides that the costs are acceptable, the process continues, otherwise she takes her computer home unrepaired. The ongoing repair consists of two activities, which are executed, in an arbitrary order. The first activity is to check and repair the hardware, whereas the second activity checks and configures the software. After each of these activities, the proper system functionality is tested. If an error is detected another arbitrary repair activity is executed, otherwise the repair is finished.

    Note: Return only the improved process diagram syntax as a simple string. No additional text is needed.

    ### Full Process Description: ###
    When a guest calls room service at The Evanstonian, the room-service manager takes down the order. She then submits an order ticket to the kitchen to begin preparing the food. She also gives an order to the sommelier to fetch wine from the cellar and to prepare any other alcoholic beverages. Eighty percent of room-service orders include wine or some other alcoholic beverage. She assigns the order to the waiter. The kitchen and the sommelier are doing their tasks. The waiter readies a cart. The waiter is also responsible for nonalcoholic drinks. Once the food, wine, and cart are ready, the waiter delivers it to the guests room. The waiter debits the guests account. The waiter may wait to do the billing if he has another order to prepare or deliver.

    Note: Return only the improved process diagram syntax as a simple string. No additional text is needed.

    ### Full Process Description: ###
    The company makes the decision to go public. Underwriters act as financial midwives to a new issue. Usually they play a triple role: First they provide the company with procedural and financial advice, then they buy the issue, and finally they resell it to the public. Established underwriters are careful of their reputation and will not handle a new issue unless they believe the facts have been presented fairly. Thus, in addition to handling the sale of a company's issue, the underwriters in effect give their seal of approval to it. They prepare a registration statement for the approval of the Securities and Exchange Commission. In addition to registering the issue with the SEC, they need to check that the issue complies with the so-called blue-sky laws of each state that regulate sales of securities within the state. While the registration statement is awaiting approval, underwriters begin to firm up the issue price. They arrange a road show to talk to potential investors. Immediately after they receive clearance from the SEC, underwriters fix the issue price. After that they enter into a firm commitment to buy the stock and then offer it to the public.

    Note: Return only the improved process diagram syntax as a simple string. No additional text is needed.

The processor shall also notify the controller without undue delay after becoming aware of a personal data breach. The notification shall include: a) the nature of the breach, including the categories and approximate number of data subjects and personal data records involved; b) the name and contact details of the data protection officer or other contact point for more information; c) the likely consequences of the breach; d) the measures taken or proposed by the controller to address the breach, including any mitigation measures. If it is not possible to provide all the information at once, it may be provided in phases without undue delay. The controller shall keep a record of all personal data breaches, including the facts, effects, and remedial actions taken. This documentation will allow the supervisory authority to verify compliance with this Article.

    Note: Return only the improved process diagram syntax as a simple string. No additional text is needed.

    ### Full Process Description: ###
    Processing shall be lawful only if and to the extent that at least one of the following applies: the data subject has given consent to the processing of his or her personal data for one or more specific purposes; processing is necessary for the performance of a contract to which the data subject is party or in order to take steps at the request of the data subject prior to entering into a contract; processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which the controller is subject; processing is necessary in order to protect the vital interests of the data subject or of another natural person; processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the controller; processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by the controller or by a third party, except where such interests are overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject which require protection of personal data, in particular where the data subject is a child. Point of the first subparagraph shall not apply to processing carried out by public authorities in the performance of their tasks. Member States may maintain or introduce more specific provisions to adapt the application of the rules of this Regulation with regard to processing for compliance with points and of paragraph 1 by determining more precisely specific requirements for the processing and other measures to ensure lawful and fair processing including for other specific processing situations as provided for in Chapter IX. The basis for the processing referred to in point and of paragraph 1 shall be laid down by: Union law; or Member State law to which the controller is subject. The purpose of the processing shall be determined in that legal basis or, as regards the processing referred to in point of paragraph 1, shall be necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the controller. That legal basis may contain specific provisions to adapt the application of rules of this Regulation, inter alia: the general conditions governing the lawfulness of processing by the controller; the types of data which are subject to the processing; the data subjects concerned; the entities to, and the purposes for which, the personal data may be disclosed; the purpose limitation; storage periods; and processing operations and processing procedures, including measures to ensure lawful and fair processing such as those for other specific processing situations as provided for in Chapter IX. The Union or the Member State law shall meet an objective of public interest and be proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued. Where the processing for a purpose other than that for which the personal data have been collected is not based on the data subject’s consent or on a Union or Member State law which constitutes a necessary and proportionate measure in a democratic society to safeguard the objectives referred to in Article 23, the controller shall take into account, inter alia: the context in which the personal data have been collected, in particular regarding the relationship between data subjects and the controller; the nature of the personal data, in particular whether special categories of personal data are processed, pursuant to Article 9, or whether personal data related to criminal convictions and offences are processed, pursuant to Article 10; the existence of appropriate safeguards, which may include encryption or pseudonymisation.

    ### Full Process Description: ###
    The data subject shall have the right to obtain from the controller confirmation as to whether or not personal data concerning him or her are being processed, and, where that is the case, they shall have the right to access the personal data and the following information: 1.	They shall know the purposes of the processing; 2.	They shall know the categories of personal data concerned; 3.	They shall know the recipients or categories of recipient to whom the personal data have been or will be disclosed, in particular recipients in third countries or international organisations; 4.	Where possible, they shall know the envisaged period for which the personal data will be stored, or, if not possible, the criteria used to determine that period; 5.	They shall know the existence of the right to request from the controller rectification or erasure of personal data or restriction of processing of personal data concerning the data subject or to object to such processing; 6.	They shall know the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority; 7.	Where the personal data are not collected from the data subject, they shall know any available information as to their source; 8.	They shall know the existence of automated decision-making, including profiling, and, at least in those cases, they shall know meaningful information about the logic involved, as well as the significance and the envisaged consequences of such processing for the data subject. Where personal data are transferred to a third country or to an international organisation, the data subject shall have the right to be informed of the appropriate safeguards pursuant to Article 46 relating to the transfer. The controller shall provide a copy of the personal data undergoing processing. For any further copies requested by the data subject, the controller may charge a reasonable fee based on administrative costs. The data subject makes the request by electronic means, and unless otherwise requested by the data subject, the information shall be provided in a commonly used electronic form. The right to obtain a copy shall not adversely affect the rights and freedoms of others.

    ### Full Process Description: ###
    The controller shall be able to demonstrate that the data subject has consented to processing of his or her personal data. If the data subject's consent is given in the context of a written declaration which also concerns other matters, the request for consent shall be presented in a manner which is clearly distinguishable from the other matters. Any part of such a declaration which constitutes an infringement of this Regulation shall not be binding. The data subject shall have the right to withdraw his or her consent at any time. The withdrawal of consent shall not affect the lawfulness of processing based on consent before its withdrawal. The data subject shall be informed thereof. It shall be as easy to withdraw as to give consent. When assessing whether consent is freely given, utmost account shall be taken of whether, inter alia, the performance of a contract, including the provision of a service, is conditional on consent to the processing of personal data that is not necessary for the performance of that contract.

    ### Full Process Description: ###
    The data subject shall have the right to obtain from the controller the erasure of personal data concerning him or her without undue delay and the controller shall have the obligation to erase personal data without undue delay where one of the following grounds applies: They shall obtain the erasure of personal data. The controller shall have the obligation to erase personal data. The personal data are no longer necessary in relation to the purposes for which they were collected or otherwise processed; The data subject withdraws consent on which the processing is based according to point of Article 6, or point of Article 9, and where there is no other legal ground for the processing; The data subject objects to the processing pursuant to Article 21 and there are no overriding legitimate grounds for the processing, or the data subject objects to the processing pursuant to Article 21; The personal data have been unlawfully processed; The personal data have to be erased for compliance with a legal obligation in Union or Member State law to which the controller is subject; The personal data have been collected in relation to the offer of information society services referred to in Article 8. Where the controller has made the personal data public and is obliged pursuant to paragraph 1 to erase the personal data, the controller, taking account of available technology and the cost of implementation, shall take reasonable steps, including technical measures, to inform controllers which are processing the personal data. Paragraphs 1 and 2 shall not apply to the extent that processing is necessary for exercising the right of freedom of expression and information; for compliance with a legal obligation which requires processing by Union or Member State law to which the controller is subject or for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the controller; for reasons of public interest in the area of public health in accordance with points and of Article 9 as well as Article 9; for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical research purposes or statistical purposes in accordance with Article 89 in so far as the right referred to in paragraph 1 is likely to render impossible or seriously impair the achievement of the objectives of that processing; or for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims.

    ### Full Process Description: ###
    The aim is to remotely interrupt the supply of electrical energy for an object, as a result of a customer change or due to open collection claims, via the central system. The shutdown takes place by opening the breaker present in the terminal. From the central system, a shutdown command is transmitted to the affected terminal. The terminal executes the received command, i.e., the internal breaker interrupts the power supply of the customer system, returns the status of the shutdown to the central system and creates an entry in the logbook. This status must be visible on the terminal. With collection there is no possibility of an immediate on-site reconnection by the customer after the blocking. Input is either deregistration of current customer, customer moves out without new tenant or customer does not pay after admonition process. The supply of electrical energy is interrupted. An entry in the logbook of the terminal has been created.

    Note: Return only the improved process diagram syntax as a simple string. No additional text is needed.

    ### Full Process Description: ###
    The prepayment function is realized via the central system. The terminal only acts as a switching device. The central system generates the shutdown command by comparing credits with consumption. The comparison of credits with actual consumption value should be made periodically. The basis is the daily readings. A "real-time monitoring" is therefore not necessary. Shutdown may only be carried out in compliance with legal conditions. Each status change of the terminal must be displayed on the device and also create an entry in the logbook. There may be a corresponding customer information about the current balance from the central system to the customer. Credit or credit limit is consumed and shutdown time is within the legally allowed time window. The supply of electrical energy is interrupted and the status of the breaker is displayed on the terminal, an entry in the logbook of the terminal is generated and the status is transmitted to the central system.

    Note: Return only the improved process diagram syntax as a simple string. No additional text is needed.

    There is an elimination of the terminal on-site by means of a mobile device via the service interface. The cryptographic parameters that authorize the device to be switched off must be stored on the mobile device. It must therefore not be possible with these cryptographic parameters to turn off several or all terminals of the terminal equipment. The cryptographic parameters must comply with the security concept from "OE Requirements Catalog End-to-End Security Smart Metering". Input is either deregistration of current customer or customer moves out without new tenant. The breaker of the terminal has switched off the system. An entry in the logbook of the terminal has been created.

    ### Full Process Description: ###
    In the course of the so-called opt-out regulation, it must be possible for customers who refuse to install an intelligent electricity meter to deactivate the load profile recording in the meter. Activation / deactivation of load profile recording must be possible remotely. Each of these changes must be logged in the relevant legal logbook of the meter. If the customer is opt-out, it must be displayed on the meter accordingly. Opt-out request of the customer to implement at the NL. Load profile recording is activated / deactivated and the information has been transmitted to the central system as ALARM or EVENT. A logbook entry has been made in the meter and the current status is displayed on the meter.

    Note: Return only the improved process diagram syntax as a simple string. No additional text is needed.

    ### Full Process Description: ###
    The load switching device is a completely independent of the meter device and serves as a possible replacement for a ripple control device or a timer. The load switching device has its own communication interface and can thus make contact with the control panel. In principle, the relays follow a switching program specified by the central system and stored in the load switching device. However, it must be possible from the central system to override the circuit program with a spontaneous command. The state of the switching device is changed. The position of each relay or each switching cycle specified by the switching program must be reported back to the central system. The relay settings must also be visually displayed on site. The central system sends a command to override a relay. The service interface is used to override a relay. The corresponding relay in the load switching device switches to the desired status, reports this back to the central system and the position of the relay on the load switching device is also visible and a logbook entry is made.

    Note: Return only the improved process diagram syntax as a simple string. No additional text is needed.

    ### Full Process Description: ###
    For each relay in the load switching device, an independent, independent of the other relay switching program should be configurable. It should be possible to subdivide the circuit program into daily, weekly, seasonal and annual programs. The switching program is managed centrally and transmitted to the load switching device via the communication paths. For control purposes, the circuit program must also be read-back. Any change to the circuit program, regardless of whether it is remotely executed, must be logged in a logbook. The central system sends changed switching programs to the load switching device. The load switching device receives the changed switching programs and records this in the logbook.

    Note: Return only the improved process diagram syntax as a simple string. No additional text is needed.
