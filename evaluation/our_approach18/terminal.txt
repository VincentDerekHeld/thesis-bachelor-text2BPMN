    ### Full Process Description: ###
    The CRS checks the defect and hands out a repair cost calculation back. If the customer decides that the costs are acceptable, the process continues, otherwise she takes her computer home unrepaired. The ongoing repair consists of two activities, which are executed, in an arbitrary order. The first activity is to check and repair the hardware, whereas the second activity checks and configures the software. After each of these activities, the proper system functionality is tested. If an error is detected another arbitrary repair activity is executed, otherwise the repair is finished.

    Note: Return only the improved process diagram syntax as a simple string. No additional text is needed.

The company makes the decision to go public.  Underwriters act as financial midwives to a new issue.  Usually they play a triple role: First they provide the company with procedural and financial advice, then they buy the issue, and finally they resell it to the public.  Established underwriters are careful of their reputation and will not handle a new issue unless they believe the facts have been presented fairly.  Thus, in addition to handling the sale of a company's issue, the underwriters in effect give their seal of approval to it.  They prepare a registration statement for the approval of the Securities and Exchange Commission.  In addition to registering the issue with the SEC, they need to check that the issue complies with the so-called blue-sky laws of each state that regulate sales of securities within the state.  While the registration statement is awaiting approval, underwriters begin to firm up the issue price.  They arrange a road show to talk to potential investors.  Immediately after they receive clearance from the SEC, underwriters fix the issue price.  After that they enter into a firm commitment to buy the stock and then offer it to the public.

    ### Full Process Description: ###
    Processing shall be lawful only if and to the extent that at least one of the following applies: the data subject has given consent to the processing of his or her personal data for one or more specific purposes; processing is necessary for the performance of a contract to which the data subject is party or in order to take steps at the request of the data subject prior to entering into a contract; processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which the controller is subject; processing is necessary in order to protect the vital interests of the data subject or of another natural person; processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the controller; processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by the controller or by a third party, except where such interests are overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject which require protection of personal data, in particular where the data subject is a child. Point of the first subparagraph shall not apply to processing carried out by public authorities in the performance of their tasks. Member States may maintain or introduce more specific provisions to adapt the application of the rules of this Regulation with regard to processing for compliance with points and of paragraph 1 by determining more precisely specific requirements for the processing and other measures to ensure lawful and fair processing including for other specific processing situations as provided for in Chapter IX. The basis for the processing referred to in point and of paragraph 1 shall be laid down by: Union law; or Member State law to which the controller is subject. The purpose of the processing shall be determined in that legal basis or, as regards the processing referred to in point of paragraph 1, shall be necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the controller. That legal basis may contain specific provisions to adapt the application of rules of this Regulation, inter alia: the general conditions governing the lawfulness of processing by the controller; the types of data which are subject to the processing; the data subjects concerned; the entities to, and the purposes for which, the personal data may be disclosed; the purpose limitation; storage periods; and processing operations and processing procedures, including measures to ensure lawful and fair processing such as those for other specific processing situations as provided for in Chapter IX. The Union or the Member State law shall meet an objective of public interest and be proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued. Where the processing for a purpose other than that for which the personal data have been collected is not based on the data subject’s consent or on a Union or Member State law which constitutes a necessary and proportionate measure in a democratic society to safeguard the objectives referred to in Article 23, the controller shall take into account, inter alia: the context in which the personal data have been collected, in particular regarding the relationship between data subjects and the controller; the nature of the personal data, in particular whether special categories of personal data are processed, pursuant to Article 9, or whether personal data related to criminal convictions and offences are processed, pursuant to Article 10; the existence of appropriate safeguards, which may include encryption or pseudonymisation.

    ### Full Process Description: ###
    The data subject shall have the right to obtain from the controller the erasure of personal data concerning him or her without undue delay and the controller shall have the obligation to erase personal data without undue delay where one of the following grounds applies: They shall obtain the erasure of personal data. The controller shall have the obligation to erase personal data. The personal data are no longer necessary in relation to the purposes for which they were collected or otherwise processed; The data subject withdraws consent on which the processing is based according to point of Article 6, or point of Article 9, and where there is no other legal ground for the processing; The data subject objects to the processing pursuant to Article 21 and there are no overriding legitimate grounds for the processing, or the data subject objects to the processing pursuant to Article 21; The personal data have been unlawfully processed; The personal data have to be erased for compliance with a legal obligation in Union or Member State law to which the controller is subject; The personal data have been collected in relation to the offer of information society services referred to in Article 8. Where the controller has made the personal data public and is obliged pursuant to paragraph 1 to erase the personal data, the controller, taking account of available technology and the cost of implementation, shall take reasonable steps, including technical measures, to inform controllers which are processing the personal data. Paragraphs 1 and 2 shall not apply to the extent that processing is necessary for exercising the right of freedom of expression and information; for compliance with a legal obligation which requires processing by Union or Member State law to which the controller is subject or for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the controller; for reasons of public interest in the area of public health in accordance with points and of Article 9 as well as Article 9; for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical research purposes or statistical purposes in accordance with Article 89 in so far as the right referred to in paragraph 1 is likely to render impossible or seriously impair the achievement of the objectives of that processing; or for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims.

    Note: Return only the improved process diagram syntax as a simple string. No additional text is needed.

The prepayment function is realized via the central system.  The terminal only acts as a switching device.  The central system generates the shutdown command by comparing credits with consumption.  The comparison of credits with actual consumption value should be made periodically.  The basis is the daily readings.  A "real-time monitoring" is therefore not necessary.  Shutdown may only be carried out in compliance with legal conditions.  Each status change of the terminal must be displayed on the device and also create an entry in the logbook.  There may be a corresponding customer information about the current balance from the central system to the customer.  Credit or credit limit is consumed and shutdown time is within the legally allowed time window.  The supply of electrical energy is interrupted and the status of the breaker is displayed on the terminal, an entry in the logbook of the terminal is generated and the status is transmitted to the central system.

    ### Full Process Description: ###
    There is an elimination of the terminal on-site by means of a mobile device via the service interface. The cryptographic parameters that authorize the device to be switched off must be stored on the mobile device. It must therefore not be possible with these cryptographic parameters to turn off several or all terminals of the terminal equipment. The cryptographic parameters must comply with the security concept from "OE Requirements Catalog End-to-End Security Smart Metering". Input is either deregistration of current customer or customer moves out without new tenant. The breaker of the terminal has switched off the system. An entry in the logbook of the terminal has been created.

    Note: Return only the improved process diagram syntax as a simple string. No additional text is needed.

**** Full description: ****
For each relay in the load switching device, an independent, independent of the other relay switching program should be configurable.  It should be possible to subdivide the circuit program into daily, weekly, seasonal and annual programs.  The switching program is managed centrally and transmitted to the load switching device via the communication paths.  For control purposes, the circuit program must also be read-back.  Any change to the circuit program, regardless of whether it is remotely executed, must be logged in a logbook.  The central system sends changed switching programs to the load switching device.  The load switching device receives the changed switching programs and records this in the logbook.
