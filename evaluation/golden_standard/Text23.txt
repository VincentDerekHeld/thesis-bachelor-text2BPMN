For each relay in the load switching device, an independent, independent of the other relay switching program should be configurable. It should be possible to subdivide the circuit program into daily, weekly, seasonal and annual programs taking into account weekly, holiday and special days.
The switching program is managed centrally and transmitted to the load switching device via the communication paths. For control purposes, the circuit program must also be read-back. Any change to the circuit program, regardless of whether it is remotely executed, must be logged in a logbook.

The central system sends changed switching programs to the load switching device.


The load switching device receives the changed switching programs (feedback to the central system) and records this in the logbook.
